## Foreword

### What is this project about

Our team at [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net) (100% open-source and privacy-focused email service) needed a better solution for DNS.

<details>
<summary>After years of using the Node.js internal DNS module, we ran into these recurring patterns:</summary>

* [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/doh/) now have DNS over HTTPS servers ("DoH") available ‚Äì and browsers such as Mozilla Firefox now have it [enabled by default](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https).
* DNS cache consistency across multiple servers cannot be easily accomplished using packages such as `unbound`, `dnsmasq`, and `bind` ‚Äì and configuring `/etc/resolv.conf` across multiple Ubuntu versions is not enjoyable (even with Ansible).  Maintaining logic at the application layer is much easier from a development, deployment, and maintenance perspective.
* Privacy, security, and caching approaches needed to be constantly scaled, re-written, and re-configured.
* Our development teams would encounter unexpected 75 second delays while making DNS requests (if they were connected to a VPN and forgot they were behind blackholed DNS servers ‚Äì and attempting to use patterns such as `dns.setServers(['1.1.1.1'])`).  The default timeout if you are behind a blackholed DNS server in Node.js is 75 seconds (due to `c-ares` under the hood with `5`, `10`, `20`, and `40` second retry backoff timeout strategy).
* There are **zero existing** DNS over HTTPS ("DoH") Node.js npm packages that:
  * Utilize modern open-source software under the MIT license and are currently maintained.
    * Once popular packages such as [native-dns](https://github.com/tjfontaine/node-dns/issues/111) and [dnscached](https://github.com/yahoo/dnscache/issues/28) are archived or deprecated.
    * [Other packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=dns%20cache) only provide `lookup` functions, have a limited sub-set of methods such as [@zeit/dns-cached-resolver](https://github.com/vercel/dns-cached-resolve), or are unmaintained.
  * Act as a 1:1 drop-in replacement for `dns.promises.Resolver` with DNS over HTTPS ("DoH").
  * Support caching for multiple backends (with TTL support), retries, smart server rotation, and [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) usage.
  * Provide out of the box support for both ECMAScript modules (ESM) **and** CommonJS (CJS) (see discussions [for](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) and [against](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/bca2fda868c1e8b2c2caf76af7dfcad3)).
* The native Node.js `dns` module does not support caching out of the box ‚Äì which is a [highly requested feature](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5893) (but belongs in userland).
* Writing tests against DNS-related infrastructure requires either hacky DNS mocking or a DNS server (manipulating cache is much easier).
* <u>**The Node.js community is lacking a high-quality and dummy-proof userland DNS package with sensible defaults.**</u>

</details>

### Why integrate DNS over HTTPS

> With DNS over HTTPS (DoH), DNS queries and responses are encrypted and sent via the HTTP or HTTP/2 protocols. DoH ensures that attackers cannot forge or alter DNS traffic. DoH uses port 443, which is the standard HTTPS traffic port, to wrap the DNS query in an HTTPS request. DNS queries and responses are camouflaged within other HTTPS traffic, since it all comes and goes from the same port. ‚Äì [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/)

> DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing remote [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) resolution via the [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) protocol. A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks) by using the HTTPS protocol to [encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypt) the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based [DNS resolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_resolver). ‚Äì [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS)

### What does this mean

[We're](https://forwardemail.net) the <i>only</i> email service provider that is 100% open-source *and* uses DNS over HTTPS ("DoH") throughout their entire infrastructure.  We've open-sourced this project ‚Äì which means you can integrate DNS over HTTPS ("DoH") by simply using :tangerine: Tangerine.  Its documentation below includes [Features](#features), [Usage and Examples](#usage-and-examples), [API](#api), [Options](#options), and [Benchmarks](#tangerine-benchmarks).

### What projects were used for inspiration

Thanks to the authors of [dohdec](https://github.com/hildjj/dohdec), [dns-packet](https://github.com/mafintosh/dns-packet), [dns2](https://github.com/song940/node-dns), and [native-dnssec-dns](https://github.com/EduardoRuizM/native-dnssec-dns) ‚Äì which made this project possible and were used for inspiration.


## Features

:tangerine: Tangerine is a 1:1 **drop-in replacement with DNS over HTTPS ("DoH")** for [dns.promises.Resolver](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#resolveroptions):

* All options and defaults for `new dns.promises.Resolver()` are available in `new Tangerine()`.
* Instances of `Tangerine` are also instances of `dns.promises.Resolver` as this class `extends` from it.  This makes it compatible with [cacheable-lookup](https://github.com/szmarczak/cacheable-lookup).
* HTTP error codes are mapped to DNS error codes (the error `code` and `errno` properties will appear as if they're from `dns` usage).  This is a configurable option enabled by default (see `returnHTTPErrors` option).
* If you need callbacks, then use [util.callbackify](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilcallbackifyoriginal) (e.g. `const resolveTxt = callbackify(tangerine.resolveTxt)`).

<details>
<summary>We have also added several improvements and new features:</summary>

* Default name servers used have been set to [Cloudflare's](https://1.1.1.1/) (`['1.1.1.1', '1.0.0.1']`) (as opposed to the system default ‚Äì which is often set to a default which is not privacy-focused or simply forgotten to be set by DevOps teams).  You may also want to use [Cloudflare's Malware and Adult Content Blocking](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/) DNS server addresses instead.
* You can pass a custom `servers` option (as opposed to having to invoke `dns.setServers(...)` or `resolver.setServers(...)`).
* `lookup` and `lookupService` methods have been added (these are not in the original `dns.promises.Resolver` instance methods).
* [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) support has been added to all DNS request methods (you can also pass your own).
* The method `cancel()` will signal `"abort"` to all AbortController signals created for existing requests and handle cleanup.
* An `ecsClientSubnet` option has been added to all methods accepting an `options` object for [RFC 7871](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7871) client subnet querying (this includes `resolve4` and `resolve6`).
* If you have multiple DNS servers configured (e.g. `tangerine.setServers(['1.1.1.1', '1.0.0.1', '8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'])`) ‚Äì and if any of these servers have repeated errors, then they will be bumped to the end of the list (e.g. if `1.1.1.1` has errors, then the updated in-memory `Set` for future requests will be `['1.0.0.1', '8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4', '1.1.1.1']`).  This "smart server rotation" behavior can be disabled (see `smartRotate` option) ‚Äì but it is discouraged, as the original behavior of [c-ares](https://c-ares.org/) does not rotate as such.
* Debug via `NODE_DEBUG=tangerine node app.js` flag (uses [util.debuglog](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utildebuglogsection-callback)).
* The method `setLocalAddress()` will parse the IP address and port properly to pass along for use with the agent as `localAddress` and `localPort`.  If you require IPv6 addresses with ports, you must encode it as `[IPv6]:PORT` ([similar to RFC 3986](https://serverfault.com/a/205794)).

## Usage and Examples

### ECMAScript modules (ESM)

```js
// app.mjs

import Tangerine from 'tangerine';

const tangerine = new Tangerine();
// or `const resolver = new Tangerine()`

tangerine.resolve('forwardemail.net').then(console.log);
```

### CommonJS (CJS)

```js
// app.js

const Tangerine = require('tangerine');

const tangerine = new Tangerine();
// or `const resolver = new Tangerine()`

tangerine.resolve('forwardemail.net').then(console.log);
```


## API

### `new Tangerine(options[, request])`

* The `request` argument is a `Function` that defaults to [undici.request](https://undici.nodejs.org/#/?id=undicirequesturl-options-promise).
  * This is an HTTP library request async or Promise returning function to be used for making requests.

  * You could alternatively use [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) or any other HTTP library of your choice that accepts `fn(url, options)`.  However, we suggest to stick with the default of `undici` due to these [benchmark tests](http-library-benchmarks).

    ```js
    const tangerine = new Tangerine(
      {
        requestOptions: {
          responseType: 'buffer',
          decompress: false,
          retry: {
            limit: 0
          }
        }
      },
      got
    );
    ```

  * It should return an object with `body`, `headers`, and either a `status` or `statusCode` property.

  * The `body` property returned should be either a `Buffer` or `Stream`.

  * Specify default request options based off the library under `requestOptions` below
* Instance methods of [dns.promises.Resolver](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html) are mirrored to :tangerine: Tangerine.
* Resolver methods accept an optional `abortController` argument, which is an instance of [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController).  Note that :tangerine: Tangerine manages `AbortController` usage internally ‚Äì so you most likely won't need to pass your own (see [index.js](https://github.com/forwardemail/tangerine/blob/main/index.js) for more insight).
* See the complete list of [Options](#options) below.
* Instances of `new Tangerine()` are instances of `dns.promises.Resolver` via `class Tangerine extends dns.promises.Resolver { ... }` (namely for compatibility with projects such as [cacheable-lookup](https://github.com/szmarczak/cacheable-lookup)).

### `tangerine.cancel()`

### `tangerine.getServers()`

### `tangerine.lookupService(address, port, abortController)`

### `tangerine.resolve(hostname[, rrtype, options, abortController])`

## Options

Similar to the `options` argument from `new dns.promises.Resolver(options)` invocation ‚Äì :tangerine: Tangerine also has its own options with default `dns` behavior mirrored. See [index.js](https://github.com/forwardemail/tangerine/blob/main/index.js) for more insight into how these options work.

## Cache

:tangerine: Tangerine supports custom cache implementations, such as with [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) or any other cache store that has a Map-like implementation with `set(key, value)` and `get(key)` methods.  If your cache implementation allows a third argument to `set()`, such as `set(key, value, ttl)` or `set(key, value, { maxAge })`, then you must set the `setCacheArgs` option respectively (see below examples).  A third argument with TTL argument support is optional as it is already built-in to :tangerine: Tangerine out of the box (cached results store their TTL and expiration time on the objects themselves ‚Äì view source code for insight).

```sh
npm install tangerine undici ioredis
```

```js
// app.js

const Redis = require('ioredis');
const Tangerine = require('tangerine');

// <https://github.com/luin/ioredis/issues/1179>
Redis.Command.setArgumentTransformer('set', (args) => {
  if (typeof args[1] === 'object') args[1] = JSON.stringify(args[1]);
  return args;
});

Redis.Command.setReplyTransformer('get', (value) => {
  if (value && typeof value === 'string') {
    try {
      value = JSON.parse(value);
    } catch {}
  }

  return value;
});

const cache = new Redis();
const tangerine = new Tangerine({
  cache,
  setCacheArgs(key, result) {
    return ['PX', Math.round(result.ttl * 1000)];
  }
});

(async () => {
  console.time('without cache');
  await tangerine.resolve('forwardemail.net'); // <-- cached
  console.timeEnd('without cache');

  console.time('with cache');
  await tangerine.resolve('forwardemail.net'); // <-- uses cached value
  console.timeEnd('with cache');
})();
```

```sh
‚ùØ node app
without cache: 98.25ms
with cache: 0.091ms
```


## Debugging

If you run into issues while using :tangerine: Tangerine, then these recommendations may help:

* Set `NODE_DEBUG=tangerine` environment variable flag when you start your app:

  ```sh
  NODE_DEBUG=tangerine node app.js
  ```

* Pass a verbose logger as the `logger` option, e.g. `logger: console` (see [Options](#options) above).

* Assuming you are not allergic, try eating a [nutritious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine#Nutrition) :tangerine: tangerine.


## Benchmarks

Contributors can run benchmarks locally by cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and running the benchmarks script:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/forwardemail/tangerine.git
cd tangerine
npm install
npm run benchmarks
```

You can also specify optional custom environment variables to test against real-world or locally running servers (instead of using mocked in-memory servers):

```sh
BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL="http" BENCHMARK_HOST="127.0.0.1" BENCHMARK_PORT="4000" BENCHMARK_PATH="/v1/test" npm run benchmarks
```

### Tangerine Benchmarks

We have written extensive benchmarks to show that :tangerine: Tangerine is as fast as the native Node.js DNS module (with the exception of the `lookup` command).  Note that performance is opinionated ‚Äì since rate limiting plays a factor dependent on the DNS servers you are using and since caching is most likely going to takeover.

The latest benchmark results are viewable on GitHub under this repository's [GitHub CI actions logs](https://github.com/forwardemail/tangerine/actions?query=event%3Apush):

> [Node 16 on ubuntu-latest](#TODO)

```sh
> node benchmarks/lookup && node benchmarks/resolve && node benchmarks/reverse

TODO
```

> **NOTE**: HTTP library benchmark tests above are not based on real-world usage; instead they are using mock libraries such as `nock` and undici's `MockAgent`.  An actual HTTP server could be implemented in these benchmarks (pull request is welcome).  See [HTTP Library Benchmarks](#http-library-benchmarks) below for more insight into results with real-world servers.

### HTTP Library Benchmarks

Originally we wrote this library using [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) ‚Äì however after running benchmarks and learning of [how performant](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1419) undici is, we weren't happy ‚Äì and we rewrote it with [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici).  Here are test results from the latest versions of all HTTP libraries against our real-world API (both client and server running locally):
